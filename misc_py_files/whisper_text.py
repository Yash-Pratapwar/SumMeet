o metan? No changes kin? No I don't see any need for change. We do have a number of guest joining us at the meeting today, but well we're at the time, so yes I'm hoping they'll be here at the required time. Happy to move in, Graham. Thanks Graham, a seconder. A second, Susan. Thanks Susan, I think that was. Cheers. All in favour please say aye. I I don't really know carried. Okay, item six which is confirmation of the minutes from 18 February. Have we all or take those as being read? Anything raised from those minutes? Andrew Graham speaking my diary showing me that I was at that meeting, but my name's not recorded there. Right. I was going to bring that up too, so I think there's some mistakes. Thanks Bruce. Okay, so I'm sure we can have that remedy, Sam. Yes, we'll make the changes. Thank you. Okay, so with that change could I have a move for the minutes to be received as a true and correct Greek or please thank you Marcus, seconder. I'll second it. Thanks Bruce. All in favour please say aye. I contrary no carried. Thank you. Item seven, Jason, has Jason joined us? He has. I see him, not in high Jason. How are you doing? Good, thank you. Great. The floor is yours. Okay, Sam, I don't think 
we had issues with trying to get the presentation. Is that right? Oh, no, Sam is sharing. Brilliant. Perfect. Thanks, Sam. Good morning. Good afternoon. Sorry, everyone. Thanks for allowing me time just to give you a quick update on where we 
are as a sector for tourism and particularly for YPAD district. So a report has obviously been provided to you and prepared which was our last six months performance at the end of 31st December 2019. As you would have seen, YPAD district council was going through significant growth, pretty one of the fastest growing regions for us with regards to tourism impact. You were experiencing double-digit growth pretty much through visitor expenditure and also commercial accommodation. But we are here today to discuss just a bit of a change in the dynamic given COVID and the impact for tourism, particularly as a sector. Go to the next slide, Sam. Perfect. So just first a couple of slides obviously, discovering off some data. 
We're now receiving international and national data on a weekly basis from the government and also from the airlines. So 
no surprise, obviously since COVID locked down in international travel restrictions, we're put in place. International visitor arrivals into New Zealand has been dropping it at a very sharp rate. We still do have airline connectivity which I 
will go through because we are still maintaining what we call a baseline service for connections across the world, mainly for repatriation flights but also for cargo and service across the country as well. Let me slide, Sam. So weekly hand transactions again, no surprise, obviously overall our visitor expenditure is down significantly. But when you do look onto the left top five, obviously food, liquor and pharmacies, we are still seeing some cumulusle and some obviously weekly growth and expenditure compared to all our other visitor type of expenditure and transactions as well. Thanks, Sam. So the impact for us as a sector, again, look, I mean, all of this has been reported but just to cover off in summary, we were 
already impacted through the loss of China group travel which started in the second to last week of January. So with that, all of our international facing products, our hotels, our motels, our Airbnb's were immediately impacted by that because many of China group travel actually did stay in the Waikato, they were our fourth largest international visitor market 
behind Australia, North America and UK Europe. It did shut us down pretty much once international travel restrictions hit us and the visitor economy covers more than just the tourism operators. Again, what mentioned accommodation, it also impacts retail, hospitality, transport providers, our operators of course but also event organizers and major venues and of 
course mystery creek of anti-trium and lake hut upheadle, a key event platforms for Waikato district. We have had significant job losses and business closures across tourism. I have down underneath that last bullet point, look, the immediate 
business impact that we have been coaching our businesses through and helping them get through is some have gone into what we call temporary or seasonal closure. So again, we have a lot of seasonality in tourism, many who would close for winter have closed but those that potentially have never closed before, we've suggested they go into hibernation. And so that's what we're calling temporary seasonal closures. We've had a number of businesses, you know, Hobbiton was obviously one of the most public ones reported in the media, but again, all our motels, hotels, retail, hospitality have pretty much reduced service and stuff. There's only essential services operating as we know, but again, with alert level three, we do 
see some opening up potentially in the hospitality sector for Waipair anyway. And then the last, obviously, implication for us as we have had a number of businesses who are permanently closing, not only are these lost definitely to the tourism industry to try and bring people back when we don't have products, but also particularly for those vulnerable communities where some of these operators have been going for many years. Thanks, Sam. All right, can I ask a question about that? Sure. Have you got examples of what businesses are struggling and like what isn't closing, like who is closing and how does impacting around the wine industry? Yeah, so particularly for Waipair, it has mainly been your hospitality, potentially some of your retail and also accommodation. So we've had many, nearly all of your accommodation has pretty much gone into hibernation or closure. They're calling it temporary closure, but there's some of them have been able to access the wage subsidy, which is great. But again, what we're going to see is the impacts are longer than the 12-week wage subsidy right now. So it's post 12 weeks, what we're quite concerned about. We have been lobbying nationally, the government, and 
I think that's all sectors, not just tourism around potentially extending the wage subsidy for 20 weeks, because it will 
take a lot to restart. The tourism sector again, people's propensity to travel is quite low. We will travel locally and potentially we will travel intra regionally, sustain within the region, but to try and stand up the domestic travel market is going to be a long haul. They were looking at it six to 12 months recovery plan for that. Great. So lastly, looking, 
I mean, nothing else to say about the priority of this, was just something we do for industry. So people know where we all fit. So from the tourism perspective, when we respond, obviously we're providing industry support right now at a national level, regional level, and also at a local level. But then we have to walk our chambers of commas, our business associations, and all local government have been great in actually supporting us with what we call the business and community support site for tourism businesses. And then lastly, we're obviously partnered with the Civil Defence Network around providing welfare support. Not just for tourism operators, again, it's also been utilising tourism operators. Many of our caterers have now been repurposed into providing food services, pretty much all supporting the food banks and actually cooking meals. We also have a number of our transport operators and tourism being basically requisitions now to provide transport options and actually getting people around, such as essential workers and many of the staff potentially were being redeployed into the Civil Defence Network through providing security and welfare and call centre as well. So not only are we also working with Civil Defence also putting staff into there as well. Even though we're obviously dealing with COVID, 
there's a disability aware there are obviously continuing issues that we're going on with COVID and with the tourism industry. First up was domestic airline connectivity. So, again, New Zealand has been pretty open that they will not be restarting until alert level 1. So, we meet with New Zealand weekly just to see how we will try and stand the industry back up again. They're going to focus very much what we call an incremental restart. So, that's doing a width and breadth strategy across the country. So, potentially maybe only two or three flights into Hamilton per day, but again, it's to try and 
get that reach across the whole network first before they can actually stand up and have a full schedule like we have seen out of Hamilton Airport particularly over the last three to four years. airline connectivity internationally is still continuing. So, those are just some are some of the ones that are still flying. So, again, New Zealand are still connecting into North America and Hong Kong into Australia. Fiji airlines are still flying into Fiji on a daily service and Qatar 
has probably probably used the most to try and repatriate northern hemisphere travelers back to their homes through Qatar and then also Korean airlines are still operating a daily service as well. For future, again, New Zealand is saying they will be focusing very much on the domestic market first. They will traditionally be a domestic airline for the first six to 12 months and domestic also includes Australia and the Pacific. American Airlines so far have been the only one we've met with who plan to return to New Zealand from October 2020. So, they have put a stake in the ground to say when they will start flying into New Zealand again. Now, the reason why I just raised international airline connectivity is because 
it will take this country at least two to five years before we ever go back to the type of connectivity we've had as a country previously before lockdown. So, again, it's going to be a very long burn for us as a country to regain international visitor arrivals we've seen in the past. Air traffic control services up for review. The reason why I just put that in 
there is just to let everyone know there was no Waikato airports or airfields but particularly Hamilton Airport is an impacted but for us in the central North Island, Rotorua is one that is going to be impacted around potentially the closure 
of air traffic control to other services. That will mean potentially that we will be redeverting the domestic network through Toronto and Hamilton. So, unfortunately, for Rotorua's last, it could be our game. And then lastly, we've still got 
the investigation underway around Fakadi White Island. So, the work safe investigation should be going to a close shortly. There will be impacts on the tourism and suppliers around adventure tourism for this country and also we will be up waiting Qualmark, which is our accreditation program particularly around health and safety for the country. Thanks, Sam. Just some of the event updates on this new we are now. Field days is going online. So, from the 30th of June for two weeks, 
field days will be providing a virtual exhibition space. There is similar to other international events who offer this type of experience. Again, it is a trial but we do hope to bring field days back in 2021. Obviously, not only is the largest major event for Wai Paa but it is definitely for the Wai Kuttle with regards to economic impact. We worked due to host 
the New Zealand tourism awards in November. That has been postponed until next year. So, we will reset the date for that. Exploring trends. These are what we call our two main international trade shows. They've obviously been delayed. Trends 
2021, which is the main time when we actually sell the Wai Kuttle to the world. We will not be having until maybe June next year. So, it's just the waiting on a date for that. Two major convention centres were due to open this year. Tepai and Christchurch, which potentially is the one that will be taking a lot of business away for us for business events. That has now been delayed for another year. And of course, in New Zealand International Convention Centre, we will not know the reopening date of that until they work through the final insurance claims. So, again, by having these two convention centres not operating, means that places like Claudeland's and the Mystery Creek Event Centre are going to be filling the gap for national and international conferences for the short term, which is actually a good opportunity for us again as a region post-COVID. But we also do still have events planned. So, the major events, obviously, the National Waka Amas at this stage still plans to take effect in Lake Kharapero. And we also have our first major event for the region, the ICC Women's Cricket Wheel Cups scheduled for the 8th of February. Again, this one will particularly be decided by around October, November, whether we see international travel restrictions have lifted to enable some of the players to come. Otherwise, they will have to go into, if it does continue, into isolation until the Cricket Wheel Cups can be held. So, what we have seen particularly for other parts of the sector is that events have been more post-COVID.'''
