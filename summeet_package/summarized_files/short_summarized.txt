He is trying to make a move. It's not happening with me. Thakur, this is the podcast going forward. For all the listeners on Spotify and Apple, you have to go to the YouTube channel. He has to update his zoom.   He doesn't know how to do it, because he doesn't have the proper software. He's not the only one who doesn't get the memo, so he's not getting the memo. He needs to update the zoom. He is not getting it. He should do it now, otherwise the podcast is not going to be aired.  He is going to change the name of the podcast to "Thakur's Pobolus" or something like that.
