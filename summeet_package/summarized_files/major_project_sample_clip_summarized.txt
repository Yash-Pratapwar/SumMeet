There is a seminar on research methodologies at Fadhar Kanshikov Institute. Yash Pratap explains to Mithun that research methodology is the specific procedures or techniques used to identify a select process and analyse information about a topic. It is a logical, systematic plan to resolve a research problem. It would be like surveys, interviews, focus groups and experiments. Mithun explains research methodology to explain how a researcher intends to carry out their research. That's it for today. Thank you for watching and see you next time.   .    I hope this is a good conclusion to your questions.  I am sure you enjoyed the seminar. I am looking forward to watching next time,
