hello friends and welcome to geeks for
geeks in this tutorial we will learn how
to reverse a stack using recursion so
here is the problem we have to reverse a
stack and we are not allowed to use
loops like while four etc we can use
functions of stacks like is empty push
and pop the idea of the solution is to
hold all the values and function call
stack until the start becomes empty when
the start becomes empty we insert all
the hell values one by one at the bottom
of the start let us now look at how it
works
let us assume our stag as 1 2 3 4 with 1
at top we pop all the values 1 by 1 and
hold all of them in function call stack
until this side becomes empty so here we
go we pop all the values until the side
becomes empty so a function called stag
in order is 4 3 2 and 1
since the stack is empty now we need to
insert all the hello elements one by one
at the bottom of stack now how to insert
elements at the bottom of stack to do so
we first pop all the elements and hold
their values in function call stack
until the start is empty then we push
the element that was supposed to be
inserted at the bottom and then we push
all the elements back let's see how it
works
since the stack is empty now we push the
first element and function called stack
that is 4 so the stack now becomes 4 I'd
talk now we need to insert 3 at the end
according to the algorithm we pop the
entire stack and hold its value in the
function called stack then we push the
element to be inserted at the end so we
pop 4 and push 3 that is the next
element in the function call stack so a
stack becomes 3 at top now we push back
all the elements and function called
stack that is element which just popped
so we push four
so our staff becomes 4 3 with 4 at the
top now we need to insert the next held
value in the function call such that is
to putting to the algorithm we need to
pop 4 and 3 and then push 2 at the top
now we will push back the elements we
just popped so our stack becomes 4 3 2
similarly we insert 1 and we can clearly
see that the stack of the worst let us
now look at the implementation this code
has been taken from geeks for geeks
website the function reverse reverses
the stack in this function if the stack
is not empty we hold all the items in
the function called stack until we reach
the end of stack then we insert all
these items one by one at the bottom of
stack using insert add bottom function
the function insert at bottom insert an
element at the bottom of stack if the
stack is empty we push the element at
the top else we pop and hold all the
values in function call stack until we
reach end of the sack when the start
becomes empty this statement again
becomes foo and the element is inserted
then we push back all the elements that
we just popped that is the elements held
in the function call stack that's it for
